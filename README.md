In the next 3 projects we will revise and relearn the concepts of real time
databases by creating a HORIZONTAL HURDLES GAME.
Have you ever seen the Olympic Hurdle game?
In this athletics game a person runs a race track that has hurdles on it. The athlete
has to jump these hurdles and get to the finish line.

In this project you are expected to create the skeleton of the project.
Create the classes/blueprint for each important entity. Example: Player, Hurdle…
Make sure you use the concepts of OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING.
Create a form to ask the user for his/her information. Ask player to enter in his/her
name. This will also be a four player game ( You could add more players to this
game if you choose ).
Create a scoring system just as you did in the car racing game. An example of a
scoring system for hurdles would be to see if a runner has:
1. Reached the finish line.
2. At which position has the player reached the finish line ( Player 3 crossed the
finish line first. Player 1 came second ).
3. If the player doesn’t jump any hurdle then stop the player and disqualify
him/her.
This will be a fun project that will test what you have learnt up till now. Remember
to use the keyword “this” in the right places.
